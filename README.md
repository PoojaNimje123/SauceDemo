I developed a test automation framework using pytest and Selenium with Python. 
The framework is organized into structured folders: locators were used to identify web elements and were stored in the Page Object folder, while the test scripts were written in the TestCases folder.
Additionally, I implemented HTML reporting to generate detailed test execution reports.
